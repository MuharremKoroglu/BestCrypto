## <h2> About This App <img src = "https://c.tenor.com/JsoERRQcZqYAAAAi/thumbs-up-joypixels.gif" width = "42"></h2>
This application is a cryptocurrency tracking application. In the application, coding was done in accordance with the MVVM structure. For this purpose, TabControl is used in the application. The first screen of this two-screen application is the login screen. Here, the user can see the cryptocurrencies they want to favorite. On the second screen, there is a list of cryptocurrencies. This list is created with the help of TableView. Information about cryptocurrencies comes via an API by coinapi.io. A model is written for the incoming data. The data received with a web service suitable for the written model has been analyzed. Then, the analyzed data was transferred into the application with a view model. A search bar has been added so that the user can find the cryptocurrency they are looking for faster in TableView. In this way, the user can quickly find the cryptocurrency he is looking for, either in uppercase or lowercase letters, from the list. This screen has been using a lot of data provided by the API for the same time. The name, value, and icon of the cryptocurrency are displayed on TableView. We showed this information with the custom TableView cell we created and added a button. When you click this button, the name of the crypto money goes to our home screen with the singleton we wrote. The cryptocurrency name that appears on the main screen is added to the API URL. In this way, specific information about the desired crypto money can be obtained. The retrieved information is added as a custom cell to the used CollectionView. This cell contains the official name and value of the cryptocurrency, as in TableView. Cryptocurrency images are normally provided via a different URL. With the view model we have written, we bring the correct data from this array according to the current cryptocurrency name. In addition, the user may want to remove any coin that he has added to his favorite. So we used the didSelectItemItemAt property of CollectionView. In this way, the user can remove that cryptocurrency from favorites by clicking on any cell. Finally, in this project, in which the code writing structure is explained, many code improvements and readability enhancement processes are provided.<br><br>
